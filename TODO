0.12.0 Release
--------------

*) [Features Menu]
	*) When the ability comes about to be able to tell if all commands are available remove the 'login', if all commands are available

*) [Commands]
	*) When a command negating 'commands' is available all $commands[] need to be set to 1 and all unavailable commands need to be set to 0. This way we don't need issets everywhere to test what's available.


Future (doesn't have to be before release)
------------------------------------------

*) [Index]
	*) Need to make an effort to cut more fat from the index

*) [printMusicTable] These tell me that we need to rewrite printMusicTable from scratch, to be more flexiable and scalable
	*) Try to fix the sort issue with filename_only files
	*) Try to remove columns that go unused from printMusicTable

*) [Streams functions]
	*) Need to conglomerate all stream stuff, these are extremely touchy functions, they need thorough testing afterwards

*) [Streams Menu] 
	*) Need to sort and put a index in this menu, it would be best if printMusicTable gets rewritten first

*) [XML Parser]
	*) Rid of duplicate code in the XML Parser functions
