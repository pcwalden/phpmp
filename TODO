0.12.0 Release - A good 0.12.0 release could be done today if needed.
--------------

Future (doesn't have to be before release)
------------------------------------------

*) [Index]
	*) Need to make an effort to cut more fat from the index

*) [printMusicTable] These tell me that we need to rewrite printMusicTable from scratch, to be more flexiable and scalable
	*) Try to fix the sort issue with filename_only files
	*) Try to remove columns that go unused from printMusicTable

*) [Streams functions]
	*) Need to conglomerate all stream stuff, these are extremely touchy functions, they need thorough testing afterwards

*) [Streams Menu]
	*) Need to sort and put a index in this menu, it would be best if printMusicTable gets rewritten first

*) [XML Parser]
	*) Rid of duplicate code in the XML Parser functions
