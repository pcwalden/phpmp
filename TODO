0.12.0 Release
--------------

*) [Features Menu]
	*) When the ability comes about to be able to tell if all commands are available remove the 'login', if all commands are available

*) [General]
	*) Need to rework the dir/dir_url stuff, somewhere it got pushed to the side and it's really a mess now.


Future (doesn't have to be before release)
------------------------------------------

*) [Index]
	*) Need to make an effort to cut more fat from the index

*) [printMusicTable] These tell me that we need to rewrite printMusicTable from scratch, to be more flexiable and scalable
	*) Try to fix the sort issue with filename_only files
	*) Try to remove columns that go unused from printMusicTable
	*) Need to rid of duplicate code, esp in the metadata switch

*) [Streams functions]
	*) Need to conglomerate all stream stuff, these are extremely touchy functions, they need thorough testing afterwards

*) [Streams Menu] 
	*) Need to sort and put a index in this menu, it would be best if printMusicTable gets rewritten first

*) [XML Parser]
	*) Rid of duplicate code in the XML Parser functions
