Future - (doesn't have to be before release)
------------------------------------------

*) [Index]
	*) Need to make an effort to cut more fat from the index

*) [i18n]
	*) Need to look into the gettext/i18n stuff

*) [printMusicTable]
	*) Try to remove columns that go unused from printMusicTable
	*) Need to make table element to take up a whole column, made specifically for metadata comments


*) [printPlaylistInfo]
	*) This table should have never gotten this big and complex. Needs to be broken down to pieces that are a page or less optimally

*) [Search Feature]
	*) Continue to add new features added for 0.12.0 in search menu
	*) Add a few new search types
		*) Playlist
		*) Streams

*) [Stream Browser]
	*) Need to implement some time & caching system as not to overload the systems that host the XML(s)

*) [Streams functions]
	*) Need to conglomerate all stream stuff, these are extremely touchy functions, they need thorough testing afterwards

*) [Streams Menu]
	*) Need to sort and put a index in this menu, make it similar to all the other tables if possible

*) [XML Parser]
	*) Rid of duplicate code in the XML Parser functions
