0.12.0 Release - A good 0.12.0 release could be done today if needed, but these would be useful if implemented, if not by 0.12.0>
--------------

*) [* Browser]
	*) Need to implement some time & caching system as not to overload the systems that host the XML(s)

*) [printMusicTable] - More is broken than meets the eye. These fixes are going to make things ugly, but it _will_ fix many issues. This
			_must_ happen before release. We can clean it up later.
	*) Seperate the metadata and non-metadata files, have the header for metadata show up after non-metadata and before
	metadata files.

	*) If the 'Time' field is removed or changed from the last value this completely breaks the musicTable.

	*) Ensure that ordered and sorts work independantly. 

*) [Error handling]
	*) There's very few errors that will be hit now (hopefully) but when it's possible we need to setup a better system 
	   for informing the use of exactly what exactly went wrong. There's probably some good ways to tell if we have/don't
	   have the zlib dependency, for example (even though I couldn't imagine a php system that doesn't have it).

Future (doesn't have to be before release)
------------------------------------------

*) [* Browser]
	*) Probably should make the XML files user configurable.

*) [Index]
	*) Need to make an effort to cut more fat from the index

*) [i18n]
	*) Need to look into the gettext/i18n stuff

*) [printMusicTable]
	*) Try to remove columns that go unused from printMusicTable

*) [Streams functions]
	*) Need to conglomerate all stream stuff, these are extremely touchy functions, they need thorough testing afterwards

*) [Streams Menu]
	*) Need to sort and put a index in this menu, it would be best if printMusicTable gets rewritten first

*) [XML Parser]
	*) Rid of duplicate code in the XML Parser functions
