Fri Dec 24 10:39:22 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Don't pass the full $lsinfo, just pass what's required respective to the function being called

Fri Dec 24 09:41:58 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Reorganize main.php to fix issues
  
  Reorganize main.php to fix a few issues with one stone. First of all I noticed that I'm pulling lsinfo twice when searching, doubling the time to display a search window. Bad news there. I moved the lsinfo out of search() to compensate for the count of displayDirectory. The fixes are pretty ugly atm but the focus is to get things working better.

Fri Dec 24 08:46:00 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Change lsinfo2directoryTable to use basename() as it's just as reliable and doesn't require an array.

Fri Dec 24 08:40:28 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Replaced yet another preg_replace with str_replace()/strpos()

Fri Dec 24 08:39:40 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com

  * Make variable requests more specific, improving security.

Thu Dec 23 06:04:52 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Fix hide option
  
  This hopefully fixes the hide option, have to revert back to globals in theme.php. This also only loads/sets the cookies as needed.

Thu Dec 23 05:17:47 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Replace strtr with str_replace
  
  Replacing strings with str_replace rather than strtr will:
  	*) Keep us from creating a useless array, time bonus there
  	*) str_replace() is about twice as fast as strtr
  
  All of this will add up seen as how the playlist will probably be loaded much more than anything else.

Thu Dec 23 04:34:32 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Get rid of all references to specific metadata tags.

Wed Dec 22 21:35:34 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com

  This enables simple moves up and down the playlist

Wed Dec 22 05:17:49 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Replace all setupGetVars() stuff with tenarary operators
  Mostly the reason this didn't happen before is because I didn't fully understand how tenarary operators worked. This patch is more than likely going to break some things, very minor fixes might be needed, but will kill three birds with one stone.
  
  	*) Get rid of all the isset() stuff clogging up the index.php
  	*) Passing variables back and forth through a array is a slow operation, these operators are going to be much faster.
  	*) Got rid of a bunch of isset()'s that were all over the place, mostly bad idea in the first place. empty() is much better.
  
  Also, this fixes remember, as I didn't notice I wasn't grabbing it in the index at startup.

Wed Dec 22 01:31:20 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com

  * lsinfo2playlistTable() simplification
  
  Removed the dirss stuff, as it's simply unneeded with basename(), only issue here is we need to find out why we have to double-rawurlencode() to get it to work correctly here.

Tue Dec 21 04:45:47 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Spacing

Tue Dec 21 04:21:50 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Sort bar improvements
  
  	*) Move it out of the for() loop
  	*) Get rid of the filenames_only stuff as it is no longer needed
  	*) Simplify where possible

Tue Dec 21 04:20:28 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Transformation to being able to pick shown metadata: Part 1
  
  Rewrote pickSort() and part of msort to:
    	*) Get rid of the old filename code in msort()
    	*) Make pickSort be smarter about what's in display_fields config field. 
    
    Still have much more code to write but this is a good beginning.

  * This completes the printMusicTable rewrite tag/file separation

Thu Dec 16 03:00:20 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com
  * Breaking down lsinfo2musicTable: Snapshot 1
  The idea right now is to break down lsinfo2musicTable() to different smaller functions, to better handle separations so that sort works as it should. This will also include a need to re(re)write printMusicTable.

Wed Dec 15 07:09:45 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com

Wed Dec 15 06:53:12 PST 2004  avuton@gmail.com

  This pretty much prepares things for the big time svn commit. Lots of cleanups and things seem to be working fairly well, although much testing is needed. Probably still a couple of records away from commit.
